# Precipitation-Nowcasting
Precipitation Nowcasting Using an AI-Enabled Probabilistic Geometric Method

This repository contains code and resources used to complete my master's thesis at Wright State University.
You can find the thesis publication at https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/etd/r/1501/10?clear=10&p10_accession_num=wright1748891568013252

Written in python using the SEVIR dataset. Information available here: https://github.com/MIT-AI-Accelerator/neurips-2020-sevir
Data is not included in this repository and must be included separately. This repo was not used during the thesis (which would have been a GREAT IDEA), but is housing the finalized code.
